# Logging

`osmdiffs run` writes `pipeline.log` to its `--workdir`, one JSON
object per line ([JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/)) —
machine-readable rather than free-form text, so a log can be grepped,
`jq`’d, or loaded into whatever analysis tool you like without first
having to parse a human-oriented formatter’s line-wrapping and colors.
Every record has:

- `timestamp` — RFC 3339, UTC.
- `level` — `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, …
- `target` — which module logged it (e.g. `osmdiffs::pipeline::conflate`).
- `message` — the human-readable text.
- `fields` — present only on records that attach structured data
  (numbers, an id, …) instead of just interpolating it into the
  message text, e.g. a pipeline step’s elapsed time and memory
  snapshot. Omitted entirely on records that don’t have any, so plain
  log lines stay plain.

See [`src/pipeline/logging.rs`](../src/pipeline/logging.rs) for the
implementation, and
[`src/pipeline/mod.rs`](../src/pipeline/mod.rs)’s `log_snapshot` for an
example of a structured record (step name, phase, elapsed time, RSS/
cgroup memory snapshot — logged at the start and end of every pipeline
step). A step can log its own internal sub-steps the same way, under a
dotted name (e.g. `fetch_inputs.osm`, `import_osm.assemble`) — not a
second logging mechanism, the exact same `run_step` helper, just called
again from inside a step for finer timing resolution than that step’s
own start/end pair alone would give. `fetch_inputs` does this for
each input it downloads (`fetch_inputs.atp`, `fetch_inputs.osm`; these
run concurrently, so their timings overlap, and a fetch cancelled
because another one failed logs an `end` record plus a "cancelled"
warning), see [`src/pipeline/inputs.rs`](../src/pipeline/inputs.rs);
`import_osm` does it for its open/prune/assemble/index-build phases,
see [`src/pipeline/osm/mod.rs`](../src/pipeline/osm/mod.rs).

## Where weekly-run logs end up

Every pipeline run uploads its `pipeline.log` to `logs/<run-id>.log` on
the **internal** S3 bucket (`INTERNAL_S3_*` — a log is operational, not
a public download; see [`PRODUCTION.md`](PRODUCTION.md)). `<run-id>` is
`--run_id` — whatever identifier the scheduler passed in (a Kubernetes
Job name, a cron invocation ID, …) — so a restarted attempt appends to,
rather than forks, its run’s single log object. If that value contains
anything outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` it is normalised for use as a key
(unsafe character runs become `_`, with a short hash of the original
appended so distinct IDs can’t collide); a value that was already safe
is used as-is. That same normalised id is stamped into
`conflated.parquet`’s provenance BOM as the workflow `uid` (see
[`outputs/CONFLATED_PARQUET.md`](outputs/CONFLATED_PARQUET.md)), so a
run’s log and its data output can always be tied back together. A local
run with no `--run_id` falls back to the process start timestamp
(`YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS`). Uploading happens regardless of whether the run
succeeded — a failed run’s log is exactly the one you want archived for
debugging, not just a successful one’s.

## Why bother

Beyond debugging a single run, having every week’s log archived means
you can compare stats *across* runs over time — memory/disk usage as
the planet grows, how a code change shifted step timings, that kind of
thing. Two concrete examples of what this data enables, both written by
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) straight from a run’s
logs, with no other tooling built for the purpose:

- [brawer/osmdiffs#665, comment](https://github.com/brawer/osmdiffs/pull/665#issuecomment-5303068423) —
  a full memory/disk/timing analysis of a full-planet run on
  memory-constrained hardware, validating the design assumption behind
  `OsmFeatureIndex` (relying on the OS page cache instead of an
  explicit decode cache).
- [brawer/osmdiffs#636](https://github.com/brawer/osmdiffs/issues/636) —
  a survey of OpenStreetMap data-quality issues, found by combing
  through `pipeline.log`’s `could not build geometry` warnings and
  cross-referencing the flagged features against the live OSM API.

Neither of those needed bespoke analysis code — just the JSON logs
already described above, and enough of them archived to look back at.
