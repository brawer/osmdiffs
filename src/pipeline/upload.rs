//! Uploads pipeline outputs to S3-compatible storage.
//!
//! There are two independent destinations, each with its own five-var
//! credential set (see [`Bucket`] and [`S3Config`]):
//!
//! - **`PUBLIC_S3_*`** -- the public downloads bucket, fronted by a CDN:
//!   `conflated.parquet` and the PMTiles archives. Intended for a
//!   Bunny.net S3 instance so objects replicate to the edge.
//! - **`INTERNAL_S3_*`** -- in-datacenter storage that never needs CDN
//!   replication: `pipeline.log`, and any future intermediates. Intended
//!   for something like Hetzner Object Storage.
//!
//! Every upload goes through [upload_file], which decides between a
//! single PUT and a multi-part upload based on the file's size (see
//! [MULTIPART_THRESHOLD]) -- multi-part's own per-part minimum makes it
//! pure overhead for something as small as a log file, but it's still
//! the right choice for larger files like tiles or `conflated.parquet`.
//!
//! Each destination's uploads are skipped (not an error) if its
//! `*_ENDPOINT` isn't set -- the established way to disable uploads for a
//! local/dev run, now per-bucket.
