//! Disk-based, memory-mapped directed graph with `u64` node IDs.
//!
//! `GraphTable` is used to represent the "is member of" relation between
//! OpenStreetMap relations: a relation may itself be a member of other,
//! "super", relations, so the pipeline needs a graph of which relation
//! (the child) is contained in which other relation (the parent).
//! [GraphTable::ancestors] walks the transitive closure of that relation
//! starting at a node; [GraphTable::nodes] yields every node bottom-up,
//! which is useful for building the geometry of a relation only once the
//! geometries of every relation it contains have already been built.
//!
//! # File format
//!
//! ```text
//! byte 0..8:  magic "graph_v0"
//! byte 8..16: edge count, u64 little-endian
//! byte 16..:  children array, `edge count` entries, u64 little-endian
//!             each
//! byte ..:    parents array, `edge count` entries, u64 little-endian
//!             each, aligned 1:1 with the children array
//! ```
//!
//! The children and parents arrays are two parallel columns of one
//! `(child, parent)` edge list: edge `i` is `(children[i], parents[i])`.
//! They are sorted ascending by `(child, parent)` (see [Edge]'s derived
//! [Ord]), which is what makes the binary search in
//! [GraphTable::parent_range] possible; a node with several outgoing
//! edges appears several times in `children`.
//!
//! The header is a fixed 16 bytes so that the children and parents
//! arrays, which follow it back to back, stay 8-byte aligned and can be
//! reinterpreted as `&[u64]` slices directly on the mmap'd bytes.
