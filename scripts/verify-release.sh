# Verify that a release actually came out right, not just that
# `.github/workflows/release.yml` reported success:
#   - waits for (or, if it's already done, immediately checks) that
#     workflow's run for the given tag to complete successfully
#   - confirms both a build-provenance and an SBOM attestation exist for
#     each per-architecture image (see docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY.md for
#     what these are and why both should exist)
#   - confirms the provenance was signed by the isolated release-build.yml
#     workflow, not release.yml itself (SLSA Build Level 3)
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/verify-release.sh vX.Y.Z
#
# This is the one manual step left after release-please.yml merges the
# release PR and publishes the release (see docs/RELEASING.md) -- safe to
# run any time after a tag was pushed, e.g. right after a release, after an
# interrupted or dropped connection, or to double-check an older release.
#
# Requirements: gh (authenticated -- run `gh auth login` first), jq
